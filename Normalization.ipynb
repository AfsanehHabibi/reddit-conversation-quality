            "{'id': 'xyt2j5', 'body': '\"Not all Rabbits are small\" - Beastars fanfic conceptI was thinking of writing a fanfic set in the Beastars universe, primarily set at Cherryton Academy (following the events of Beastars manga\\'s conclusion). The star of the fic would be a Flemish Rabbit named Xerxes (after King Xerxes, the Persian King who fought the 300 Spartans - his father was named Darius the Great - like how Legosi takes his name from Bella Lugosi). He would be very friendly, social and gregarious (similar to Jack), but his large size makes him somewhat unpopular among other Rabbits (like how Haru\\'s friends at school wouldn\\'t let her eat with them at the cafeteria). His lack of fear of Carnivores and willingness to befriend them also gets him seen as weird and suicidal - since many Herbivores view Carnivores as dangerous by nature.\\n\\nSo Xerxes has a hard time making friends amongst his fellow Herbivores for that reason, which bothers him because he doesn\\'t want to be a loner who everyone gives sideways glances to. His size also makes him stand out in the crowd, and most Carnivores, while finding his size fascinating, don\\'t offer genuine friendship, more they patronise him, because he\\'s still an Herbivore, and society dictates they be nice to Herbivores of all sizes. Xerxes picks up on this and it bothers him, since he cannot make any real friends due to his size and odd nature.\\n\\nBut he meets a female Red Fox, named Vix, and becomes infatuated with her, though she keeps her distance for fear of hurting him. Like how Ai devoured that male rabbit who made advances on her and her carnivore instinct kicked in. Xerxes doesn\\'t understand why she\\'s keeping her distance, he\\'s a bit bigger than her (due to him being male and Foxes are smaller than most Dog breeds) and he doesn\\'t feel she\\'d ever hurt him - but those fangs and claws could still seriously hurt him, and she knows that.\\n\\nSo part of Xerxes\\' arc would be trying to befriend Vix, while she struggles with the fear she\\'ll hurt him - not only because she doesn\\'t want to see him harmed, but she knows what\\'ll happen to her if her instincts kick in and she mauls him by accident. There\\'s also the fact that, similar to Legosi\\'s conflict on if his love for Haru was genuine, or if it was his Carnivore instinct leading him on, Xerxes\\' own instincts complicate his feelings for Vix. As his teenage hormones flare up around her, and he doesn\\'t want to feel that\\'s what\\'s making him attracted to her.\\n\\nThere\\'s also that issue many Herbivores have where they ignore their instincts of self preservation (like when Haru\\'s instincts were telling her to run from Legosi when they had dinner), and while in Xerxes they are mostly dormant (due to his breed being bred to be more tame and less skittish than most Rabbits), he still gets anxious if Carnivores bear their fangs around him. So he stubbornly wants to think he can conquer that anxiety, he doesn\\'t want that to keep him and Vix apart.\\n\\nSo in a way it\\'s like a role reversal of Legosi and Haru, where the male is the one at risk of getting hurt if they\\'re not careful. Then of course you have anyone on the outside looking in, thinking Xerxes has a death wish pursuing a Red Fox like Vix, even if he\\'s bigger than her, he\\'s still an Herbivore and she\\'s a Carnivore. And if there\\'s any animal Red Foxes evolved to prey on, it\\'s Rabbits.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIs this a fic anyone would be interested in?', 'author': None, 'reply_to': None, 'conversation_id': 'xyt2j5', 'politness_score': 0.3333333333333333, 'readability_score': -3.5, 'has_reasoning': True, 'site_ref_count': '0'}\n",

So Vix would have equal plot relevance and agency to Xerxes, unlike Haru who fell off 25% of the way through the manga and became a minor character. So Vix would have her own arc, struggles and storyline where she is the main focus. Right up till the end so she is always relevant and important to the plot.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI'd also try to add some Juno and Haru to her arc, like as a Red Fox, Vix is attractive and popular, but at the same time she feels insecure because alot of the attention and praise she gets, rings hollow to her. Like if she wasn't attractive...Would her friends still like her? This can cause her to be aloof and rude at times, since she has a hard time telling genuine friendship, apart from desperate simping, especially with guys.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThat also causes some tension between her and Xerxes, she's not used to an Herbivore being into her, so on top of her worrying she's going to hurt him, she doesn't know how genuine his feelings are. Like how Louis tries to downplay Legosi's feelings for Haru, saying he's just got a fetish and she was the first woman to acknowledge him - Vix wouldn't be sure if Xerxes truly likes her for who she is, or if he's just into Carnivores like some weirdo Rabbit.\", 'author': 't2_8205r3xr', 'reply_to': 'irktwxg', 'conversation_id': 'xyt2j5', 'politness_score': 0.47619047619047616, 'readability_score': -2.5, 'has_reasoning': True, 'site_ref_count': '0'}\n",

            "{'id': 'xyt2ex', 'body': \"What's the Lyme/ ALS correlation?Hi everybody. I'm a 24 year old male and I've been having a very hard time since July. Went from still feeling completely normal and healthy in June to feeling pretty crappy since then. It was initially tough pinpointing the cause since I had quit taking kratom right at the end of June, so I suspected withdrawals were to blame. But by the time withdrawals should've ended I was still feeling off. About a week and a half after quitting kratom (also a week and a half after I was working in thick brush where I could've picked up a tick), I started having arm/ hand tingling, jumping body pain in hands, feet, calves, etc, then later started having vision issues (blurrier in one eye, light sensitive, visual snow/flickery vision, more frequent floaters). Also noticed very early on that I was having certain days where it was tougher coordinating my arm/hands/ leg movements. Never had a fever, and as far as fatigue it has only hit certain days, whereas certain other days I've had tons of energy. Initially my doctor recommended going back on kratom for a bit to see if I feel right again but it didn't fix anything.\\n\\nI ended up getting tested with a LabCorp test (I know they're not great) and it showed negative for Lyme and babesiosis, but I asked for antibiotics anyways. Of course my doctor only gave me 10 days worth of doxy in early September. I felt pretty good my first few days after completing it but have struggled to string together multiple good days in a row since then. I ended up speaking with a friend who dealt with Lyme disease six years and got to where she could barely walk, and she couldn't use antibiotics so she recommended some stuff for me to take that helped her get it under control (organic wheatgrass, Brocco-glutathione, lion's mane, and methyl folate). That stuff seems like it has helped me to an extent but has more held back the floodgates of spreading infection rather than actually wiping it out.\\n\\nEnded up having a neurology appointment to rule out and brain issues causing my symptoms, scheduled an MRI (it showed normal) and got retested for Lyme the same day a couple weeks ago, this time a western blot. It showed IGg P41 as the only positive band but I'm still not convinced I don't have Lyme and co. \\n\\nBut this week has been freaky. Thursday I noticed my arms feeling very shaky and weak the whole day, with a constant feeling of tingling and twitching around my shoulders. Then woke up yesterday with my legs also feeling shaky and as if I could fall down pretty easily. \\nMy movements when bending, sitting, moving my neck are becoming so rigid/unsmooth! Twitches have spread to my legs, face, some in my hands, and I've noticed my fingers twitching involuntarily if held still. Sometimes my neck hurts and it's tough to keep my head up and I've also had constipation this week. I've had trouble keeping my phone still while holding it and trouble keeping my silverware still when eating. And during this whole journey I've definitely had periods of crying and it seems like the smallest thing can set it off. A lot of this seems to line up with ALS but when combined with the Lyme &amp;co symptoms like vision issues, etc, could this be Lyme setting off ALS or mimicking the symptoms?? I've seen other posts mentioning people who had ALS from Lyme and it started going away with Lyme treatment, or seen where people have been misdiagnosed with ALS for it to be Lyme instead. Seems weird that I was feeling much more capable and unshaky a few days ago but now I'm just super shaky and more clumsy. Is this consistent with Lyme as well? I'm looking at finally aligning with an LLMD but I so hope getting treatment started will roll back these symptoms.

It cannot be something that happened later, like adultery. Some annulments are easier to prove, and some are harder. \\n\\nAlso, it is not something that the Church is infallible on. The Church can get it wrong on your particular situation, but still we are only held accountable to what the Church declares (\"what you hold bound on Earth is bound in Heaven; what you loose on Earth is loosed in Heaven\").\\n\\nThe Church will do a pretty in-depth investigation. Both of you will have to submit lots of written testimony and witnesses. They will especially want to talk to the priest and the witnesses (usually the Maid of Honor and the Best Man).

I do think most American Catholics don\\'t understand or intend to give themselves fully in marriage at the time it takes place.\\n\\nFor example, if you have a pre-nuptial agreement like who will get what in a divorce BEFORE you get married, it does indicate that one or both of you do not intend to give yourself freely and fully in marriage.\\n\\nAlso, if you intend to use birth control after you are married (which, let\\'s face it is pretty common unfortunately), then you are not really pledging your full self to your spouse which would include fertility, which is a huge part of the Catholic faith.', 'author': 't2_3q5sxuyw', 'reply_to': 'iriuxq4', 'conversation_id': 'xyt2ef', 'politness_score': 0.5238095238095238, 'readability_score': -1.5, 'has_reasoning': True, 'site_ref_count': '0'}\n",

God sent his Son into this world save sinners. Jesus did this by sacrificing his sinless body of flesh with its blood to pay the price of the condemnation that is in Adam. What was needed in such a savior sent by God was that he be human, without sin, and that he, in effect, takes Adam's place, that he takes the condemnation that is upon Adam and all of Adam's descendants so that the condemnation can be lifted upon Adam and all of Adam's descendants. To do this, God prepared a body of flesh and blood for His Son, and made His Son a little lower than the angels so that His Son could offer that body of flesh with its blood to Jehovah for the sin of the world, thus becoming the savior of the world whom Jehovah sent. -- Luke 22:19; John 1:29; 6:51; 14:19; Romans 5:12-19; 1 Corinthians 15:21,22; 1 Timothy 2:5,6; Hebrews 2:9;10:5,10; 1 Peter 2:24; 3:18; 1 John 4:9-14.\\n\\nNevertheless, Jesus, before his ascension, did indeed raise up his former body for various appearances. After Jesus' God (Micah 5:4; Ephesians 1:3) raised Jesus from the dead (Acts 2:24,32,26; 3:15; 4:10; 10:40; 13:30,33,37; 17:31; Romans 4:24; 8:11; 10:9; 1 Corinthians 6:14; 15:15; Galatians 1:1; Colossians 2:11,12; 1 Thessalonians 1:9,10; 1 Peter 1:21; 3:18), Jesus did not immediately ascend to heaven, but he stayed on the earth for 40 days, during which time, as he had foretold (John 2:19-21), he raised up his former body for various appearances to his disciples. (Luke 24:39; John 20:20,25,27; Acts 1:3) It was not until after he ascended into heaven that Jesus became a priest who could offer to his God (Ephesians 5:2; Hebrews 9:14) his body of flesh with its blood for our sins, after which he sat down at God's right hand (Hebrews 10:10,12), since as long as he was on earth he could not be a priest. (Hebrews 8:4) This does not mean that God raised Jesus in the flesh and not in the spirit. It would simply mean that Jesus was first raised from the oblivious condition of death with the heavenly, celestial bodily glory. Jesus then could raise up his body of flesh as needed for various appearances.\\n\\nIf we reason that Jesus was raised in the flesh, rather than in the spirit, then his resurrection would have simply been earthly, fleshly, and not heavenly, spiritual; he would, in effect, still have been a man, having a glory that is a little lower than the angels, and he would again be in the days of his flesh here on the earth. (1 Corinthians 15:39-41; Hebrews 2:7; 5:7)  Jesus was put to death in the flesh for our sins, but he was not raised in the flesh, but in the spirit. -- 1 Peter 3:18.\\n\\nThe Bible does not tell us, nor is it necessary for us to know, how Jesus' body was preserved during the 40 days before his ascension. After that body was offered to God for our sins, we can assume that in some way God consumed that body in acceptance of its being offered for sin.\\n\\nActs 2:31 says nothing to the effect that Jesus' body of flesh would never be offered to God for our sins, or that it was to be in existence for eternity. His body certainly did not see decay; this was so it could be made an offering for sin.\\n\\nThere is nothing in any scripture that means that we need to believe that Jesus was raised in his fleshly body, not with a spiritual, celestial, body. Jesus is now exalted by his God to the highest position (name) in the universe, aside from his God, far above the angels. He is no longer a man of flesh, having the glory that is lower than the angels. -- Acts 2:33,36; 5:31; Philippians 2:9; Ephesians 1:3,17-23; 1 Corinthians 15:27; Hebrews 1:4,6; 2:9; 1 Peter 3:22.\\n\\nFor links to some of my own studies related to Jesus' resurrection body:\\n\\n[https://ransomforall.blogspot.com/p/jesus-resurrection-body.html](https://ransomforall.blogspot.com/p/jesus-resurrection-body.html)\", 'author': 't2_8y5li', 'reply_to': 'xyt2ch', 'conversation_id': 'xyt2ch', 'politness_score': 0.38095238095238093, 'readability_score': -1.5, 'has_reasoning': True, 'site_ref_count': '1'}\n",

He said the Father is in me and I am in the Father John 14:11>>\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThe word \"spirit\" (Hebrew, ruach; Greek, pneuma) in the Bible is used with various applications. As the spirit of life that gives the power from God to be alive, it is also referred to in the Bible by the Hebrew word often transliterated as Neshamah. Thus, in this respect, the Bible crosses the usage of neshamah with the usage of ruach in many places. Jesus was surely born into this world and God surely gave to him the breath or spirit of life, as he did Adam. This spirit is in all of mankind, as well as lower animals. -- Genesis 2:7.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nOf course, without that spirit, the body of flesh is dead. It should be obvious, however, that this was not what Peter was talking about in 1 Peter 3:18. Jesus sacrificed his body of flesh to bear our sins. (1 Peter 2:24) Jesus could not offer up his body of flesh to God as an offering for sin before he ascended since he could not be the priest after the manner of Melchizedek as long he was still on earth. (Hebrews 8:4) After his ascension, he became a priest, and he officially completed the offering of his body of flesh to his God for our sins. (Luke 22:19; John 6:51; Ephesians 5:2; 1 Timothy 2:5,6; Hebrews 9:4,14; 10:5,10,12; 1 Peter 2:14; 3:18) Peter would not be saying that he was raised back into the body of flesh that he was put to death in. In 1 Corinthians 15, Paul does not describe Jesus as now being with the fleshly bodily glory that is earthly, but he describes Jesus as being with a spiritual body, with the heavenly bodily glory. Paul speaks of the two kinds of resurrection bodies that one can receive in the resurrection in 1 Corinthians 15:35-50. He says \"the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.\" (1 Corinthians 15:40) And he states: \"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.\" (1 Corinthians 15:48) Jesus, while in days of his flesh, was earthly, having a bodily glory that is a little lower than the angels. (Hebrews 2:9) He now no longer has that bodily glory, but he now has a bodily glory that is not of the dust of the earth that is with a glory that is a little lower than the angels, but which spiritual, heavenly, bodily glory that is far above the angels. -‚Äî Psalm 2:7; Acts 13:33; Ephesians 1:17-26; Philippians 2:9; Colossians 1:18; Hebrews 1:5; 5:5. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nJesus, while in the days of his flesh (Hebrews 5:7), was the antitypical Adam, but only as related to Adam before Adam sinned. -- Romans 5:14.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThe neshamah or ruach that God gives to living creatures here on earth is from God Himself, but it is not itself God Almighty. Jesus did say that his God and Father is in him and that he is his father and also that he -- Jesus -- is in his followers and his followers are in him. (John 14:20; 15:5) This union is not referring to all mankind, but rather only to those who belong to Jesus. Jesus is referring only to those who love Jesus, and keep his word. (John 14:23) Jesus illustrated this by the vine and its branches. (John 15:1-8) Jesus prayed for all his followers to have this same union that he has with his God and Father. (John 17:1,21) Further, we read that those who belong to Christ are in God and that God is them. (1 John 3:24; 4:13,15,16) This is not speaking the spirit that is common to all mankind that makes them a living soul. -- Genesis 2:7.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWhen Jesus died, the neshamah, or spirit of life, that God gave to him returned to God who gave it as is common with all mankind. (Ecclesiastes 12:7) Of course, when Jesus was raised from the dead, it is possible that Jesus\\' spirit was returned to him bodily, in a spirit body in which God has given the plentitude of might (Colossians 2:9), not as a human being having the glory that is a little lower than the angels (Psalm 8:4,5; Hebrews 2:7,9), but as a mighty spirit being far above the angels. He is no longer a man of flesh, having the glory that is lower than the angels. -- Acts 2:33,36; 5:31; Philippians 2:9; Ephesians 1:3,17-23; 1 Corinthians 15:27,39-46; Hebrews 1:4,6; 2:9; 5:7; 1 Peter 3:22.-- 1 Corinthians 15:39-46.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI have a study related to Neshamah at:\\r  \\nhttps://ransomforall.blogspot.com/2022/08/gen2-7.html\\r  \\nI have a study related to the resurrection body at:\\r  \\nhttps://ransomforall.blogspot.com/2022/10/body.html', 'author': 't2_8y5li', 'reply_to': 'irjqavd', 'conversation_id': 'xyt2ch', 'politness_score': 0.38095238095238093, 'readability_score': -1.5, 'has_reasoning': True, 'site_ref_count': '2'}\n",

Thus, he could take upon himself the condemnation that is upon Adam and all of Adam\\'s descendants. As result, the condemnation would be lifted upon Adam and all of Adam\\'s descendants.

(Luke 24:39; John 20:20,25,27; Acts 1:3) It was not until after he ascended into heaven that Jesus became a priest who could offer to his God (Ephesians 5:2; Hebrews 9:14) his body of flesh with its blood for our sins, after which he sat down at God\\'s right hand (Hebrews 10:10,12), since as long as he was on earth he could not be a priest.

(1 Corinthians 15:35) He explains that what is being sown now by the new creature is not actually the body that will be in the resurrection, but rather that what is sown he likens to a bare grain, a seed, and that God gives (appoints) to that seed a body as it pleases him, to each seed its own body. He appears to be likened the regenerated son of God in this age to a seed or grain that is being sown. The regenerated seed is first appointed a body as Adam had before Adam sinned. Adam before he sinned, was incorrupt, upright, but he was corruptible. Adam had not yet proven himself incorruptible. Instead of proving himself to be incorruptible, however, Adam became corrupt, crooked, due to disobedience.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nGod prepared a body for Jesus was equal to Adam before Adam sinned. Unlike Adam, however, Jesus remained obedient to his God, and thus did put on incorruption. So with the children of God who become regenerated in this age. They, as being a regenerated seed, are first assigned a body like Jesus\\' human body, fleshly, not celestial, spiritual. Until they overcome -- prove themselves incorruptible -- as did Jesus, they are incorrupt as new creatures, but they are still corruptible. But the seed is to be raised, grown, into an incorruptible condition from which it cannot be corrupted. Thus, when the corruptible seed puts on incorruption, for that person death is swallowed up in victory. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nI have links to some of my studies related to this at:\\r  \\n[https://jesusnotyhwh.blogspot.com/p/1-corinthians.html#1cor15-35](https://jesusnotyhwh.blogspot.com/p/1-corinthians.html#1cor15-35)', 'author': 't2_8y5li', 'reply_to': 'istfzmx', 'conversation_id': 'xyt2ch', 'politness_score': 0.47619047619047616, 'readability_score': 0, 'has_reasoning': True, 'site_ref_count': '2'}\n",

It was not until after he ascended into heaven that Jesus became a priest who could offer to his God (Ephesians 5:2; Hebrews 9:14) his body of flesh with its blood for our sins. After presenting the offering to God, he sat down at God's right hand. (Hebrews 10:10,12) As long as he was on earth he could not be a priest to present the offering to God. -- Hebrews 8:4.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n<<His body did not have to be annihilated (like in a burnt offering) for the atonement to be accepted.>>\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI know of no scripture that presents such an idea. Evidently, Jesus' body was in some way consumed by God; the Bible does not tell us more. Since the condemnation upon Adam would have been eternal had the man, Christ Jesus, not offered himself as a ransom to offset what Adam did (Romans 5:12-19; 1 Corinthians 15:21,22; 1 Timothy 2:5,6), the offering had to be an offering for eternity -- not something Jesus could take back. One does not offer an offering to God and then say, but I want my offering returned to me. Additionally, if Jesus did take it back, then the offering was not a complete offering, and Adam and all of Adam's offspring are still under the condemnation in Adam.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n<<I don't believe Jesus created a physical body (and then destroyed it) after each appearance to his followers after the resurrection.>>\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI don't believe he did such either. I do believe that his former body was somehow preserved so that Jesus could raise the body up for various appearances.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n<<I understand you believe Jesus is Michael the Archangel, so maybe the spirit body was either destroyed or put into a holding area when Jesus became a man and then he received a new spirit body or retrieved his previous spirit body from the holding area after the resurrection?>>\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThe scriptures do not give details, so anything such as the above would have to be speculation. Since the body Jesus received when he was resurrected has the exalted plentitude of might (Colossians 2:9,10) needed for him to be over all, more than likely it was not the same spiritual body that he possessed before. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nEvidently, his former spiritual body before he became flesh did not have the same power, the mightiness, of the body that Jesus was raised with. He has been exalted with power far above all dominions (Ephesians 1:17-23), with the evident exclusion of God Himself (1 Corinthians 15:27). Evidently, before he became flesh, Jesus did not have the bodily power that he now has. God exalted him to the highest position in the universe, far above the angels, next to the only Most High.-- Acts 2:33,36; 5:31; Philippians 2:9; Ephesians 1:3,17-23; 1 Corinthians 15:27; Hebrews 1:4,6; 1 Peter 3:22. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nOf course, God could have preserved his former spiritual body and returned it to Jesus with a highly exalted glory.

            "{'id': 'irkzz65', 'body': 'I ran games with high people count and unpredictable schedules before on two very different settings and rulesets and conditions. It\\'s very doable but the number 1 rule is no long-term parties. You can\\'t play a \"Fellowship of the Ring\" story with 12 people with modern lives and schedules. There are two different approaches here: either the players are completely irrelevant, expendable and the arch is all about the world and events or you go completely opposite and give every single character their own arch.\\n\\n Small actors don\\'t matter too much, there\\'s a bigger goal for all of them but anyone can be replaced. Example: I ran a Starship Troopers d20 open seat game in a comic book store for a year or so. Any day I could have 2 to 14 players, some people would enter and leave anytime, some would show up every week and even ask for more sessions. Everyday, the game flow was as follows: I\\'d show up with a bunch of both filled and empty character sheets (they could keep them and level up before next session if they survived, they\\'ll erase their names and inventory and return them to the pile when dead). Everybody is a soldier in a unit and got new orders. I\\'d brief and motivate them a bit, then the team (whoever showed up) divided their orders in sub-tasks and made a plan. We set a starting table and start playing encounters and scenes. Their goal was to rush into sure dead and make some progress in order to have done with the mission by the end of the session. Dead people and newcomers took new tasks or where commissioned to return the gear (not necessarily the bodies) of their old selfs. I\\'d let them drive the game and do whatever they wanted and limit myself to play the horde and explain rules. In your case, your players could be soldiers too, rebel group, religion, clan, members of a guild or adventurers trying to build a new one. The thing is they all have an aligned goal and some sort of duty. Don\\'t hesitate to kill a player (or accept your death). Big groups don\\'t pair well with plot armor. If they were in control and someone ended up dying don\\'t mask it. I\\'d let them a free epic last breath action, like putting a granade into the next big bug\\'s butt or whatever they come with. And if you spare them instant death, make them at least unable to keep going for the rest of the session. Having a few people die for a goal will make it more valuable, like it\\'s a serious thing they care more than their own lifes. Be sure to have some prefilled character sheets for the players to come back asap.\\n\\nMy second example is a 18 people Mage: the Ascension I ran during lockdown. Most of it was played by phone or video call, sending a few pics and support media. The schedules were inexistent. People coming in an out for 20 min, an hour, having different chat groups, relating to each other anytime of their lives in character and keeping me up. So for this game I took a complete opposite approach: The goal is whatever each player chooses to do. Each player writes their own single story. Probably none of them will ever see the whole picture. This is a sandbox. If you happen to find other players (and well, I\\'m going to seed the character backgrounds and push a little for that to happen) and want to do stuff with them they\\'ll just schedule and meet me for a session. If they want to discuss anything, trade, or plan they can do it anytime without me being present. \\n\\nThis is a lot of work (you\\'ll need to journal each single player and make stuff for them) but it\\'s also alleviating because it takes out of the DM the pressure of schedules, witnessing endless loop arguments between players and having to come up with reasons why people just appear and disappear all the time. If your group is willing to switch DMs you can achieve a pretty self-managed game in which organic groups form for specific reasons, work on different tasks and then put it all together. You can use also DM-less systems or mix them with dm sessions.\\n\\nIn this case I went completely opposite of my past brutality and decided that \"death\" just means \"incapacitation for the current scene and task\" and probably a sequel. But wether a character survived or not was a choice of the player. The goal was each player played a character like in a novel, witnessing or taking part in the events, talking to other characters, growing up, digging in their past and interacting and shaping with the world.\\n\\nFor this approach I prepped three main archs that would unravel in the character surroundings and wrote a lot of modular stuff: NPCs, data, rumours, events, locations, encounters, scenes, puzzles, rooms, one-shots and even a wargame. If too many showed up I\\'d throw a social event or skirmish. If it was a single player or two we\\'d work on their development, past things they learnt, aspirations and expectations or a npc scene or challenge. If there were 3-6 we\\'d play adventuring or action.\\n\\nThis helped me a lot setting the tone of the game, shaping the world and realizing the kind of stuff I wanted to tell. But at the end of the day none of my carefully prepared archs really developed and players kept sandboxing and focusing on their own characters instead. Most of the time I just asked them questions about their lives, their acquaintances, the places they visit and we\\'d develop them together until we find some conflict that could come with an interesting and unknown outcome and narrate a scene at that point. Sometimes I\\'d through hooks or introduce my prepped stuff, but I\\'d present it as a side, casual thing and only leaf to new scenes when the game starts to stagnate or they want to pull the thread.\\n\\nHaving a bunch of independent players doing stuff on their own is the most chaotic and live force you can add to the narration. You need to have something to offer, but the most interesting things are the unexpected ones that happen in the way. This system is quite suitable for multi-dm/dmless and solo games as long as each player keeps their own journal and validates his content with everybody else.\\n\\n Even if you want to keep secrets and spying between players, you can have a daily roll and whoever takes lower must reveal their full journal in text and whoever already stated in their own journal they were spying can read it and anyone else get to ask a lower roll player if they\\'re spying on them (no cheating, we\\'re grownups).

I don\\'t care that much about any individual definition, but I do care about definitions in general. As in why certain ones are chosen, correctness and whether or not that even can be a thing, usefulness, etc.\\n\\nThe other thing is that although I don\\'t care what definitions we two use, because we can clarify, however if you\\'re *correcting* others I still think you need a reason. The latter I do care about\\n\\nWhich leads to the second point:\\n\\n> It\\'s literally a place meant for people to express their opinion\\n\\nI just did, did I not? My opinion is that opinions on definitions are meaningless to me. Clearly I can deal with that. I didn\\'t say you\\'re not allowed to state your opinion. I said that doing so was (in that very specific context), in my opinion, pointless.\\n\\nBecause they\\'re mostly arbitrary. Sure, there\\'s a reason behind widely used definitions, but that has to do more with how they arose, rather than the definition itself being more or less valid or anything like that.\\n\\nFurthermore, pure opinions are in some sense, worthless in the context of correction. If someone likes chocolate, saying you dislike chocolate is kinda pointless. It\\'s only meaningful if you have common opinions. For example you could say that you dislike chocolate because it has too much sugar, which is something the other person potentially agrees on, which could affect their opinion.\\n\\nSo if someone says the sequence of letters \"natural\" has some meaning to them, then you saying that sequence of letters doesn\\'t have that meaning is pointless because that\\'s literally as far as you can go with that conversation as definitions are arbitrary.\\n\\nEdit: And before someone points out the potential hypocrisy here: The difference is that I\\'m not saying you should or should not be using a certain definition. I\\'m saying that you really can\\'t convince others that a specific definition is or is not correct, because correctness isn\\'t a thing. You *can* convince others a certain definition is more or less common or useful.\\n\\nFurthermore, despite me having gone to the effort of stating all this, the whole thing is still sort of moot because composite words have no actual obligation to carry on the meaning of individual words. Regardless of whether or not the sequence of letters \"natural\" are associated with natural stigmata, their label, their commonly used name, is still \"natural stigmata\".', 'author': 't2_ki6w5', 'reply_to': 'irkmznm', 'conversation_id': 'xyt1lv', 'politness_score': 0.5238095238095238, 'readability_score': -0.5, 'has_reasoning': True, 'site_ref_count': '0'}\n",

The cups are no different just because they have a practical use and to argue against the cups would be an agurement against any product of limited availability which if you believe that is fine, but to single out gamersupps individuallly would be a faulty argument. Now in response to people wanting there to be regularly available cups gg has actually made starter cups that are always available and are restocked for those who want a gg branded cup to go with their drink, but don't want to be forced to buy a cup minutes after launch. The only scummy thing I can think of is there's no limit on how many of one cup you can buy, so you have people buying 5,6,7 of a cup to resell later.

It takes time to make real friends in Japan, but believe me, a Japanese friend is truly a good friend. \\n\\nWhen you join a club or an activity, you will know people with same interest than yours, and they can introduce you to their single friends (male friends) that they know.

This was good, as [[Draw of the Fruitful Earth]] was able to actually stop a build. First major for Earth was [[Twisted Flowers Murmur Ultimatums]]. This, of course, was not playable from the start but after I got to TL2 I used it couple of times to survive the next ravage.\\n\\nOn Turn 3 I drew another major for Earth, and I drew [[Sea Monsters]]. Wetland being the first card and letting [[Independent Resolve]] go on the first High Immigration meant that the wetlands were quite built up. From there on I spammed it on B1/B2 while keeping these two lands be the capital.\\n\\nGreen held its two wetlands using [[Choke the Land with Green]] before it drew [[Rites of the Land's Rejection]] which was able to stop multiple builds. Also Earth drew [[Teeming Rivers]] and Green [[Guardian Serpents]], [[Tigers Hunting]] so I was able to plan the game entirely on beast damage and defense.\\n\\nSea Monsters quickly brought me close to the end of the fear deck and when [[Explorers are Reluctant]] gave me a turn with no ravages, I was able to rush to the end of the fear deck, winning the game.\\n\\nI haven't played a lot with Green.

This meant that, one way or another, I wouldn't be able to Stone my way through an 8-damage ravage in B2, which would trigger the Habsburg loss. I didn't even have the option of not adding blight on the other board's one towned land.\\n\\nThe fear cards pulled me back from the brink. [[Scapegoats]] bumped B2 back below the LC threshold, and I made the tough (possibly wrong?) choice to only use [[Tread Carefully]] once, on the other board's last unmanaged ravage, in order to let B2 go through and kill a city and town with [[Let Then Break Themselves Against Stone]]. And then! I flipped [[Aid From Lesser Spirits]] (which only got 2 blight total thanks to Blitz rules), and immediately had to use one blight on the cascade.

The intro screens, match screens, after match cards +++ will obviously be fixed, no way theyre gonna keep it in its current state. As with all dev projects, they had a too optimistic release schedule. Didnt get around to it. But it will be fixed, ¬´I miss the old screen¬ª , sure, but its not like its meant to stay like this for 5 years.\\n2. Loot boxes, sure, in an ideal world you would pay 30 bucks, get lot of free cosmetics AND free frequent content updates, but this simply isnt a viable business model, youll be leaking money till its a zero profit project with the size of the dev team. Also, a lot of countries have banned buyable lootboxes.\\n3. Is the current battlepass and shop prices bad, oh yes, but weve already seen leaks with more generous currency rewards and other variants of pricing. My bet is it only makes sense to start with the ¬´worst¬ª version and tune it up to a state where its descent for both players and blizz.

This account is used to pay mortgage, loan, utilities, and household items. I contribute 57% of this account's funds and she contributes 43%. \\n\\nWe broke-up about 2 months ago (have no children) and haven't really spoken since and we both still live in the house. I would like to keep the house and I know she can not afford it on her own. \\n\\nI received a letter from her attorney yesterday. It is very vague and states she contributed to the mortgage and loans, and that the house has increased in value from its original purchase price. It goes on to say that if I don't respond with by 10/14/22 a suit will be filed. It does not specify an amount or what will be sought in the suit. \\n\\nI immediately contacted several lawyers, but only was able to speak to 2. Both of them told me that this was not their area of expertise and referred me to others who did not get back to me yesterday.  \\n\\nOne of the lawyers I spoke to told me that he think she has no case, but just referred to another lawyer (who I haven't been able to speak with yet). \\n\\nThe other lawyer I spoke to told me I shouldn't even get an attorney. To either call my ex-gf's attorney, ask what is being sought and come to an agreement or just ignore the letter (calling their bluff in his works).

But somewhere down the line he and Dan made the decision that it would be better to have the film reflect the actual passing of time between the two movies and they liked the idea of an older team of Ghostbusters wisened by experience, leading to them developing a script picking up with the Ghostbusters five years later having fallen from grace and having to reclaim their past glory.

Rail bridges are less susceptible since the plate members are typically thicker (likely 75mm flange thickness and 25mm web) compared to a highway bridge that is half as thick.

He says that regular therapy is not equipped to handle the type of issues an abuser has and may even wind up making things worse. Abusers need a specialized batterer intervention program, *not* conventional therapy. From \"Why Does He Do That?\" part I \"The Mythology\":\\n\\n>**\"But it is virtually unheard of for an abusive man to make substantial and lasting changes in his pattern of abusiveness as a result of therapy.** \\\\[...\\\\] He may work through other emotional difficulties, he may gain insight into himself, but his behavior continues. **In fact it typically gets worse, as he uses therapy to develop new excuses for his behavior, more sophisticated arguments to prove that his partner his mentally unstable, and more creative ways to make her feel responsible for his emotional distress.** Abusive men are sometimes masters of the hard-luck story, and may find that accounts of childhood abuse are one of the best ways to pull heartstrings. \\\\[...\\\\]  \\n>  \\n>My clients who have participated extensively in therapy or substance-abuse recovery programs sometimes sound like therapists themselves--and a few actually have been-as they adopt the terms of popular psychology or textbook theory. One client used to try to lure me into intellectual debates with comments such as, \"Well, your group follows a cognitive-behavioral model, which has been shown to have limitations for addressing a problem as deep as this one.\" An abusive man who is adept in the language of feelings can make his partner feel crazy by turning each argument into a therapy session in which he puts her reactions under a microscope and assigns himself the role of \"helping\" her. He may, for example, \"explain\" to her the emotional issues she needs to work through, or analyze her reasons for \"mistakenly\" believing that that he is mistreating her.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>**\"The more psychotherapy a client of mine has participated in, the more impossible I usually find it is to work with him.** The highly \"therapized\" abuser tends to be slick, condescending, and manipulative. He uses the psychological concepts he has learned to dissect his partner\\'s flaws and dismiss her perceptions of abuse. He takes responsibility for nothing that he does; he moves in a world where there are only unfortunate dynamics, miscommunications, symbolic acts. He expects to be rewarded for his emotional openness, handled gingerly because of his \"vulnerability,\" colluded with in skirting the damage he has done, and congratulated for his insight. \\\\[...\\\\] **I have yet to meet an abuser who has made any meaningful and lasting changes in his behavior toward female partners through therapy,** regardless of how much \"insight\"--most of it false--that he may have gained. The fact is that if an abuser finds a particularly skilled therapist and if the therapy is especially successful, when he is finished he will be a happy, well-adjusted abuser--good news for him, perhaps, but not such good news for his partner. **Psychotherapy can be very valuable for issues it is devised to address, but partner abuse is not one of them; an abusive man needs to be in** ***a specialized program\\\\[.\\\\]\"***', 'author': 't2_1tlgxcwt', 'reply_to': 'xyt0jx', 'conversation_id': 'xyt0jx', 'politness_score': 0.38095238095238093, 'readability_score': -7.5, 'has_reasoning': True, 'site_ref_count': '0'}\n",

Lundy  himself said take what parts of the book match your experience and leave the rest.\\n\\nMy coach and her organization focus on recognizing these instead of a cycle, and here is how they explained it to me:\\n\\n1.) overt abuse (verbal abuse etc.) which Lundy describes in the book\\n\\n2.) Covert abuse, which may include manipulation through acting nice, or acting like he\\'s changing but it\\'s just to get you off his back just enough to continue the abuse. Lundy desribes this in the book iirc.\\n\\nThere is also a potentially a subcategory here of \"he\\'s giving *himself* a break from acting angry because acting angry takes a lot of energy. He\\'ll be back to it after he\\'s had enough of a break.\" This is obviously a form of the  abuse as it gets our hopes up and he\\'s just building up energy to be angry again.\\n\\n3.) The process of *starting* to change. There is going to be some #1 and #2 mixed in. The person may be addressing some behaviors and just starting to chip away at bad mentalities but it\\'s not a true turn around yet. It often takes someone skilled to  help you distinguish between #2 and #3, and maybe even some #1  mixed in.\\n\\nWe often don\\'t have enough data to tell if it\\'s #3 yet or not. If he IS changing he will understand that you cannot trust him yet. My coach talks about \"having your lab coat on\" and observing.\\n\\nIt\\'s up to the person being abused and his/  her safety level as well, how long one wants to stay in \"observing\" phase. Unfortunately even if it is #3, few people keep changing as their old mindsets eventually take over again fully. The thing is-- even if it\\'s #3 we our reactions should be almost the same as #1 or #2. The only main difference is that the person being abused might choose to delay legal action, basically, IF we seem physically safe enough.\\n\\nTo be clear, #3, even if it is really #3, is still a bad situation to be in as it\\'s so easy for him to slide back at that stage. Lundy mentions that-- he says that when someone is making small changes they usually do not last. Plus, we can be wrong about if it really was #3 or not. BUT there are ways to learn to tell more accurately if it\\'s really #3.\\n\\n4.) TRUE change, which Lundy describes in the book very well\\n\\nI\\'m just offering a slightly different paradigm my coach and her professional organization provided.

The reason you don\\'t trust him is because he is demonstrating his untrustworthiness right in front of your eyes and he has manipulated you into thinking that you are somehow in the wrong for seeing reality clearly right in front you.\\n\\nYou don\\'t have \"pessimism\" about the situation. You have lucidity. You are not \"one of the lucky ones.\"\\n\\nI understand that you don\\'t like what you see, but you are not an ostrich: burying your head in the sand by blaming yourself for not believing in your boyfriend hard enough when he\\'s given you zero reason *to* believe in him, or blaming Bancroft\\'s book for giving you the tools to understand what\\'s going on here, is not actually going to warp reality and change the situation. It won\\'t go away because you cover your eyes.\\n\\nTrust yourself. Trust your own eyes and ears. Stop listening to his whining about how hard he\\'s supposedly trying and judge him *by his actions.* Anyone can claim that they\\'re trying hard to be good, whether or not their behavior resembles the behavior of someone who is genuinely trying is what matters.\\n\\nAlso, stop sending him to that therapist and look up a batterer intervention program if you really want him to get him help for his problem. [You can find a list for assessing programs\\' reliability from Bancroft\\'s own website.](https://lundybancroft.com/articles/assessing-monitoring-programs-for-men-who-abuse-women/)\\n\\nBut most importantly, stop focusing on him and start focusing on yourself. Your recovery should be about your needs, your healing, not his. Get your own therapist, or join a support group for abused women. Work on your dreams, hobbies, or goals. Give yourself permission to feel good about yourself.

Oral chlamydia is rare and when present, generally in extremely small amounts, believed by many experts to often be DNA only, i.e. no living chlamydia that can be transmitted. This is why almost no public health authorities, from CDC on down, recommends oral chlamydia testing routinely. It's often done anyway, because oral gonorrhea IS common and often transmissible, and testing is reasonable; and chlamydia testing usually is automatic when gonorrhea testing is done. But it is rarely if ever recommended to test specifically for oral chlamydia.\\n\\nAfter he contacted you, were you tested with a positive throat swab? Even if so, it doesn't prove you were the source of your partner's genital chlamydia. Do you know for a fact your oral sex on him was his only sexual experience in the preceding couple of months? And for sure he tested positive for chlamydia, and not just diagnosed with nongonococcal urethritis (NGU)?\\n\\nReturning to your initial question:  of course you are not to blame and your partner should not react or behave as if you were. For most STIs, and for sure those like chlamydia that are a) usually asymptomatic  and b) almost as common in people considered low risk as in those at high STI risk, any new STI in a new partnership is equally the responsibility of both partners, not just the one first infected.

That would be 15amps. now most people have recommended Victron and they offer a 35A controller. Would having a controller with over double the amps I need have any negative effect?

            "{'id': 'xyszzj', 'body': \"Lifelong PE sufferer, and I tried PYT last night. Here's my thoughts...So I'm in my 30's. Had lifelong PE forever. Basically can't last more then 5-10 strokes to reach PONR.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the years I've tried stud 100, tramadol,  paroxetine and kegel control techniques. Stud 100 too numbing for me, tramadol worked excellent as did paroxetine for 9 months or so, but i didn't want to pump drugs into my system so intention always for them to be short term. Kegel excercises, tbh, nowhere near enough in isolation, for someone with lifelong severe PE. From my experience\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, so bought PYT from: https://www.naturetherapy.co.uk/pau-yuen-tong-old-chinese-delay-balm-premature-ejaculation-orgasm-enhancer-58g-490-p.asp    took about 4 days to arrive and 2025 expiry\\r\\n\\r\\nUsed this as a general guide- https://youtu.be/Sta2IPjqwy8\\r\\n\\r\\nFor context, amount in vid seemed such a small amount i probably ended up applying double. I applied to my 'head' (glans) area only, pulling back foreskin. I focused on frenulum, and rest went on everywhere else of head (and i kept about maybe a 0.5cm away from peehole). Didn't touch my shaft at all really. I allowed my foreskin to then cover my head fully after application\\r\\n\\r\\nI applied at about 4 pm, and got to business with gf at about 11pm or so.\\r\\n\\r\\nI rinsed with just water, maybe 30 min before sex.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 40 min or so of initial application, i started noticing tingly, stinging sensation, which lasted hours. I would say it never got above a 6/10 for discomfort, but obv we all have different pain thresholds. It 'maybe?' decreased with time, but also i think i might have just got used to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen i rinsed 30 min prior to sex, my head was noticeably red. But wasn't a worrying allergic reaction or anything, as at this point during kissing etc, i had gotten hard no issues with no erection pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo during sex i wasn't 100% rock hard, obviously cos i applied too much. I'd say i was able to get to 80% erection quality which fluctuated to about 70%.  Pleasure here was maybe 6/10, so ye, not amazing. \\n\\n(I was wearing a condom, so this might have felt better without, as an aside for those who don't need condom) \\r\\n\\r\\nSo during sex etc, with above in mind, i could not orgasm even if i tried. Tried numerous positions for 30-40 min. So we stopped, (maybe half 12 now) and just talked until about half 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo i went for it again, and IMMEDIATELY noticed i had full erection, basically felt 9/10 pleasure (used condom throughout), and sex lasted maybe 5 min, but was basically full erection and full pleasure. Which told me the product definitely works, i just need to experiment (without product, I'd last 10 strokes maybe) \\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point in my pe experience, I'm pretty much certain those with lifelong severe PE, it's a physiological issue\\r\\n\\r\\nI know there's some talk aboit long term safety etc of pyt, so i only plan on using sparingly.. Max 2x times a week for now then see how i do\\n\\nIn morning my glands were no longer red, so no adverse issues. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut with above in mind, anyone on this sub who has not tried pyt balm who has lifelong PE, i rec you do atleast once, from whatever trustworthy seller you can find.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it a long term, permanent solution?.. ... Probably not.

Over the homecoming weekend, she runs into her college flame -- the one who got (okay, ran) away. The one she‚Äôs never forgotten. As they spend time together, both Prudence and Matt realize that their post-graduation break-up was a mistake. On Sunday afternoon, Matt impulsively proposes and the two plan to wed that summer. But before marrying Matt, Prudence has a problem to deal with -- her husband Reilly. \\n>\\n>Prudence could divorce Reilly like a normal person, but she‚Äôs far too wacky for that. Her solution is to secretly find a new wife for Reilly to replace herself after she and Matt marry. This shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult, she decides. After all, she lives in Manhattan where there are plenty of single women. And she can enlist the help of her three best friends: a costume-wearing advertising executive, a saucy single mother and a level-headed gay artist.\\n>\\n>Though the newly engaged couple lives on opposite coasts, Prudence still finds herself in as series of near-misses trying to keep Matt and Reilly unaware of the other‚Äôs existence. Ever-fumbling Prudence gave her new boyfriend the idea that she is a widow. Her husband has no idea that his wife has a fianc√© in California.\\n>\\n>Through singles ads and a ‚ÄúWife of Reilly‚Äù gallery exhibit, the gang of four meets New York‚Äôs nuttiest single women looking for love. Among the pack, Prudence crosses paths with a recovering lesbian who has just graduated from Straight Expectations rehabilitation center, a horrifying mirror image of herself, and an aspiring writer who lost interest in her own memoirs mid-draft. Along the way, Prudence is rejected by an insipid kindergarten teacher, pumped for investment tips by a demanding attorney, and swarmed by wannabe wives of Reilly. And she finds herself intensely jealous of a creative young playwright who declared Reilly ‚Äúdamaged goods‚Äù after learning that he is not actually Prudence‚Äôs brother (as she originally claimed).\\n>\\n>Through her eight-month search, Prudence ultimately helps find the next wife of Reilly, though not at all in the way she had originally planned.

Yes, flame me all you want. This was my first time dealing with any kind of crypto currency during this time and ignorantly didn't do my research, but I got all of this out of my system. Moving on, USDC-SPL isn't supported on the Coinbase exchange, so it has been sitting in that SOL address ever since. I sent Coinbase numerous emails asking them to send the funds back or at least try to help me, but they basically said they can't do anything about it. Randomly decided to check my account today to see if there's any updates on USDC-SPL support, but I found that Coinbase has actually transferred my USDC to their CEX wallet around 4 days ago! (https://solscan.io/tx/2fUoJcmxCa4Ce7msVaNepYq3kTNXN3gCFLvXPmVvAqM5Wrw8qdWxrRKm3GBy6PHz1Hwrp9xFgoqLX8KqDPArdegt) Surprise, surprise! Coinbase didn't even bother returning the funds back to the original sender address and I was willing to prove that I am the owner of that address. But, they had no problems transferring all my funds out of the SOL exchange wallet to their CEX wallet without even notifying me or asking to approve the transaction... what a load of doggy doo doo bullshit.

            "{'id': 'irj3rp0', 'body': 'I\\'ve got 3 liqueurs that have been resting for about a week now (pineapple-jalapeno, apple cinnamon, and kiwi-starfruit), and I just bought more spirits yesterday to start a few more batches. I\\'m far from an expert but so far I haven\\'t made anything I don\\'t like.\\n\\nIn general, the steps are: infuse liquor, dilute, and sweeten. Sounds simple (and it can be), but there is nuance, particularly in which botanicals (fruits, herbs, spices) you use and how they are prepared.\\n\\nLet\\'s look at a basic coffee liquer for example. It only has 4 ingredients: coffee, rum, water, sugar.\\n\\nRight off the bat when we infuse the spirit we have so many choices. Whole bean or ground? if so, what grind size? The surface area of your botanicals will affect the speed of infusion. A whole bean will take more time to give the same amount of flavor as a coarse grind. A fine grind might let out too many undesired flavors. \\n\\nAs you can see there\\'s a lot of room for experimentation, but keeping it simple we will just pick one and roll with it. For example, a coarse grind that we let infuse in a dark place for 2 weeks. We can taste it at the end of week 1 and week 2. It\\'s done when it tastes like coffee flavored rum. If you want a subtle coffee flavor, go less time. If you want a strong punch that will stand up to other flavors in a drink, go longer. The infused spirit should taste like a finished product (though it may not be balanced). So compare that coffee infused rum to coffee flavored vodka you might find on the shelf. Trust me, ours is way better.\\n\\nGreat, so we\\'ve got an infused spirit. We may have been precise about tasting and timing, or maybe we left it in a closet for month and decided it\\'s time to move on to the next step. \\n\\nStrain the botanicals out of the spirit. (If you\\'re obsessed with clarity we can do that later). Now we need to make the syrup. Take the botanicals (the coffee grounds we just strained out of our rum) and weigh them. Write that number down. Weigh the strained spirit and write that number down.\\n\\nNext we\\'re making simple syrup with your botanicals. If you know how to do that you can skip this paragraph. Put the botanicals in a pot and add enough water to cover. You can weigh the water now or later. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and let steep. (Exactly how and how long you infuse the water can vary depending on your botanicals; when in doubt, look up a simple syrup recipe for those botanicals). When the water is infused, strain the botanicals out and add sugar (see note below). Heat the sugar and water until sugar is dissolved. Let cool.\\n\\n\\nAlright so now we\\'ve got our coffee-infused rum and our coffee sole syrup. Now all we gotta do is add them together. Start with a small glass and experiment with water, the syrup and the alcohol. Find a ratio that tastes good to you. Sweetness cuts the alcohol burn alot more than you\\'d expect.\\n\\nOnce you find a ratio you like, mix the whole batch up that way! Let it sit on a shelf and taste it every month or so. You\\'ll be surprised how the flavor can change; harsh chemical flavors go away completely and the drink gets much smoother.\\n\\nThe final step (this is important) is to tell all your friends and family about this awesome coffee liqueur you made and invite them over for espresso martinis.\\n\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\nDifferent botanicals want to be treated differently. When you\\'re using something for the first time, do some research. Consult other recipes, look at forum posts, just get a feel for how people are using it and what notes they have. Here\\'s some off the top of my head:\\n\\n-fruit with a lot of water (raspberries, strawberries, prolly blueberries) can be muddles directly into the liquor. This is how framboise (french raspberry liqueur) is made. For a watery fruit I would look into a recipe like this.\\n\\n-dried citrus peels and fresh citrus peels are not the same. Don\\'t just swap them 1:1, they infuse differently. Also if you want to make a citrus liquer, see how limoncello is made and copy that. It\\'s infused vodka and oleo saccharum.\\n\\n-if you want to mix a lot of flavors and you\\'re not sure about the ratios between them (simple ex: I want a dreamsicle liqueur, should it be equal parts orange and vanilla or 5x orange to 1x vanilla?), Infuse the flavors separately into tinctures (small batches of infused liquor) first. Combine the tinctures to find the ratio you like, then do a fresh batch with everything in one infusion. \\n\\n-Or you could do two separate infusions and mix them before you sweeten and dilute. This would be helpful if you wanted ingredient A to infuse for a month, but ingredient B to infuse for only a week.\\n\\n-Sugar. You can use any kind of sugar! Muscovado, turbinado, demerara, molasses, honey, palm sugar, maple sugar, go crazy! Sugar can be a source of flavor if you want it to. Use white sugar if you don\\'t want to taste it. Note that different sugars want to be treated differently. For example, don\\'t boil honey, you will boil off it\\'s floral flavors. Also keep in mind that different sugars have different water contents. \\n\\n-Alcohol. The alcohol you choose is also a source of flavor, if you want. Use vodka if you don\\'t want to taste it. Personally I like the game of mixing and matching alcohol, sugar, and botanicals to find a combo that works well. Flavorless spirits also work well if you\\'re like me and you sometimes buy the spirit before you know what you\\'re making. \\n\\n-Also, since we\\'re heavily flavoring, sweetening, and diluting this booze, you don\\'t need top shelf. Personally I like this local brand that\\'s $12.50/750mL. It\\'s got some notes of acetone but you can\\'t tell that when I\\'m done with it. Of course, that acetone is still there and will probably contribute to a worse hangover, which is an argument to stay off the bottom shelf.\\n\\n-Proof. Higher proof spirits will infuse flavor faster. That\\'s why whiskey is aged in barrels at a high proof (\"cask strength\"). Note that if you add water later, there is a chance of the ouzo effect which will cause unavoidable cloudiness. This is especially noticeable when you water ever learn down to 40%, or with certain botanicals (citrus for example).\\n\\n-Overextracting. Sometimes you get flavors out of a botanical that you don\\'t want. Infusing in everclear for two months will give you a lot of flavor, but it\\'s not a guarantee that all those flavors will be good. There\\'s lots of room for experimentation in the infusion step as I mentioned previously. You want to get as much of the good flavors out, and stop it before you get the bad flavors out.\\n\\nWell I think this was long enough. Who knows how much time I spent writing.

However, I'm not experienced with Reddit.  \\n\\n\\nI'm writing Epic Fantasy. I'm trying to work out the best way to show the following:\\n\\n1 - dialogue in a foreign language.\\n\\n2 - dialogue in that language that is understood by magic ability.\\n\\n3 - dialogue in that language that is understood because someone knows the language (eg is a native speaker or has learned to speak it.)\\n\\nThere are likely to be scenes in the future where I will need to distinguish between the latter two for the plot. (For reasons way too complicated to go into here.)\\n\\nI've had a lot of contradictory advice from many sources, and with some hunting online, I found one example in a traditional publication of a similar need (where that author used &lt;&lt;word&gt;&gt;  to distinguish between someone signing and someone speaking, when the pov understood both).\\n\\nThe scene below only includes 1 and 2. Any place where the dialogue is fully understood by all parties because they speak the language, I'll just use English with ordinary formatting.It's first draft; I'm just interested in getting the formatting sorted out.\\n\\nI don't want to just put 'he said in Kandaran' over and over, because not only is that telling, not showing, I have never found that it really works when I'm reading a book as a reader. Visual cues work better. eg, some authors use Spanish punctuation to show that a character is really speaking Spanish even though, in the book, it's written in English.\\n\\nAn additional complication is that I'm using 3rd person close, so italics also mean thoughts.\\n\\nHere's the scene.

The Tyreans were presently congregated on the large middle deck, engaging in some kind of physical contest. Cherex and the other Xiantonii had climbed up to the forward upper deck, from where they watched the fights.\\n\\nSharell wanted to be as far away from them as possible to have some privacy to practise her new Gifts, pointless as it seemed, when her powers would vanish when they reached Lastport.\\n\\nOne reason those birds were flitting madly around the masts was because they were seeing illusions.

But they liked the way I'd done the foreign language and it's translations by magic. I'm going to try to reduce internal thoughts close to any untranslated Kandaran.  \\n\\n\\nFor 3, that's exactly what I said I'm going to do where they're both speaking the same language. I never even suggested I would write that in Kandaran.   \\n\\n\\nThere's no babelfish. Only some of them can understand by magic, and my MC won't be able to use her magic power to do that most of the time, because if her former commander finds out that she's got magic, he'll kill her, and he can sense magic use. So she has to try to learn the language. For those sections where she can't use her power, someone will have to translate for them if the Kandarii aren't speaking Reythian. \\n\\n The Kandarii cannot possibly speak the same language as the Reythians because the continents have been separate for 2000 years. There's no way they wouldn't have developed a separate language. I'd be shouting at any book whose author made so basic a mistake. I'm a professional archaeologist in my real life.  \\nThe educated among the Kandarii learn Reythian like people used to learn Latin in High School until quite recently, but the Reythians didn't even have the concept of another language existing until a few days ago. It's all come as a nasty shock to them.  \\nThe language is loosely based on a real language. I crossed Icelandic with old Norse, with a slight Gaelic twist here and there, and  swapped out some vowels and consonants on every word and added a few other tweaks here and there. There's even an online dictionary for it. Anytime I need a new word, I look it up in Icelandic and Norse, change a few letters, and add it to my online dictionary. It's internally consistant and if someone finds the dictionary, it may even be possible to translate it. It's not just made up gibberish.  \\n\\n\\nBut I guess the answer to my question is that italics are standard for foreign language, and there's no standardised way to show translations understood by magic (odd that.) I have seen <<word>> used for translations of sign language in a fiction book, which was the closest I could find. So, so long as I'm consistent, it should  work.

            "{'id': 'irk99fr', 'body': \">There's no babelfish.\\n\\nYou misunderstood me. What I meant is the convention is that the READER has a universal way to understand everything spoken in the text, not the CHARACTERS. Among them, wreak as much confusion and havoc with linguistic misunderstanding as you like!\\n\\nBut demonstrate it to the 'fourth wall' with a light hand that always moves the core narrative forward. Other then some broad strokes 'sprinkles' to add flavor and variety, you don't need to do too much to demonstrate the actual nitty gritty of everything linguistic to the READER. 'Susan rattled off something in Kandarian, Bob had no idea what it was' will do over 4 paragraphs of confused multi-language dialogue that flexes your linguistic skills, for eg.\\n\\nAnd no matter how carefully you create a language, let alone several, it's still going to be gibberish to the reader. No one is reading High Fantasy to go on a linguistic learning journey (though if you get dedicated fans, they will love that sort of thing...but you've got to get them there first.)\\n\\nRemember the major big other thing about writing- immersion, immersion, immersion. Anything that breaks their immersion- even a brief sigh of 'not this again' is going to break the spell your book weaves on the READER.\\n\\nThis is actually why italics serve so many purposes in narrative- they become background noise, but background noise that immediately positions the reader into what you need from them. Things like this are like traffic lights in the work- we all go on green, but few of us stop to wonder why its green, or even really actively think 'it's green now so I can go'. We just go.\\n\\nIf I can offer one piece of advice, it's this: Work on putting over the Reythians confusion, their bewilderment, their difficulty... not their internal language words. THAT is what will sell it to the audience, not how this word isn't like the other. Don't put that onus on the reader to sus out that confusion because 'Maman' and 'Mother' are different words...sell it through their emotional connection to the scene.\\n\\nBut as the author, you can also train them a little as well. That's why I mentioned that consistency will matter the very most. Think of how quickly everyone who reads the Discworld came to understand that WRITING DEATH'S DIALOGUE LIKE THIS (no matter the Discworld language he's speaking, we get ALL CAPS ENGLISH) was all the complex and difficult things around an animated personification of death with no lips expressing himself in some unknown way to the character's minds around them, for example. It Just Works (tm).\\n\\nNow I think of it, Sir Terry does a great job at Sam Vime's bewilderment talking to the Klatchian family running a takeaway who don't speak...whatever it is they speak in Ankh Morpork... that shows this perfectly. You might want to take a look at it. It's in *Guards Guards*!\\n\\nEase them in, stay absolutely consistent with structure, and it will work. Don't sweat the world-building over the story too much. You are currently on the verge of putting the world-building first. As someone who's been there, done that, got slapped in the face by an editor, choose the KISS method and get back to work on the story over everything else.\", 'author': 't2_13l7am0x', 'reply_to': 'irk50x6', 'conversation_id': 'xyszkr', 'politness_score': 0.5238095238095238, 'readability_score': -0.5, 'has_reasoning': True, 'site_ref_count': '0'}\n",

Not making progress and feeling hopeless.\\nThis is the first time I\\'ve ever had a therapist so I need some advice.\\n\\nSo the reason I sought out a therapist is that I strongly believe that I have severe ADHD. I have huge issues with executive function, focus, motivation, energy, procrastination, isolation, self-esteem and avoidance. I thought meds and therapy could help with all that. My therapist does behavioural therapy. The problem is that I feel like I\\'m not capable of meaningfully changing my behaviours. I\\'m not making any progress whatsoever. After a few sessions of testing and talking, she diagnosed me with depression and social anxiety and said I \"probably\" have ADHD.\\n\\nOnce we got started with proper therapy, I started to feel that she is expecting things of me that I\\'m simply not capable of. Some exampels: I told her I have an extremely hard time building habits and sticking to them, she suggested I go for a walk every day after waking up. Failed at that. She then told me that I should try to get a job, something I really don\\'t think I can handle. I can\\'t bring myself to ask people I have known since early childhood if they\\'d like to hang out, and simply going for a walk consistently is impossible for me, but she expects me to get a job where I need to be reliable, work with people who count on me, have to deal with strangers, etc? Seems like such a huge leap.\\nIt\\'s feels like being told to run a marathon because my legs work so I\\'m *in principle* capable of it.\\n\\nThe two latest sessions just consisted of her monologuing about how I\\'m too comfortable (I have been living at home since I dropped out of university for the second time about a year ago, so maybe that\\'s true), not motivated enough and how she doesn\\'t know how to help me (I can kinda see why to be fair). She also suggested that I go inpatient, which seems rather... extreme. At the end she told me to think about what she said and to give my thoughts on it next time I see her. \\n\\nThis has left me feeling really stuck. \\nShe seemingly expects me to \"just do things\" but my biggest issue is precisely the fact that I can\\'t  \"just do things\". The focus on behaviour to me seems like putting the cart before the horse. After all, behaviours are a result of feelings and thoughts so shouldn\\'t those be addressed first? \\nThe more I think about it, the more I come to the conclusion that this isn\\'t the right therapist and approach for me, but I\\'m not sure where else to go or what form of therapy would be more suitable. I could also simply wait and hope things work out somehow.\\nI\\'ve finally managed to get an appointment with a psychiatrist who specialises in ADHD so I can officially be diagnosed and prescribed meds, maybe that would help me do better in therapy?

I took hiking shoes but my husband wore Nike tennis shoes and was fine. I thought at the beginning of the trip I was not going to wear the closed toed shoes as much as I though, but I wore them frequently because lava rock is sharp (both the large chunks and the gritty stuff that kept getting in my sandals), some areas were cold (Mauna Kea visitor center was like 50F when we stayed for sunset and star gazing and Volcanoes was chilly at night/early morning when seeing the lava glow), and some areas just caked my shoes in dirt/mud (hike down to Pololu).  Also, the Big Island is generally pretty hilly and I found it easier to walk in closed toes rather than sandals sometimes.\\n\\n\\nFor rain protection, I recommend ponchos (or just getting wet as most of the rain is warm).

Bear with me.**\\n\\n**Context first: \"Darknet Dairies\"** is an investigative podcast chronicling stories about hackers, cybercrime, Internet privacy, and so on. In one episode they interviewed **the convicted hacker Ghost Ex0dus.**\\n\\n* Ghost Ex0dus\\' \"mother was a pastor married to a pastor\" in a church that was very demanding. He wonders if it was a cult \"led by a megalomaniac\". His life had been very micromanaged. \"There was a lot of injustice\" under which he was suffereing. And he saw others suffering. To compensate, he developed a need \"to help people who didn‚Äôt have a voice and to help people who didn‚Äôt have the technical capabilities to defend themselves\": he started hacking for them.\\n* \"This was during a time when cyber-bullying was this type of ‚Äì it‚Äôs like an epidemic. There were no real, viable means to help people who were experiencing cyber-bullying. Schools were not up to ‚Äì did not have a policy that knew how to deal with this. Law enforcement neither had any type of platforms where they could reach out and help people who were being affected by cyber-bullying. In my own life, my life being dominated and being controlled, being constantly subjected to ridicule and injustice, I just took my experience and then tried to find some type of solace by helping others.\"\\n* He had joined hacking groups that had goals he agreed with morally. But like many hacktivist groups, his one grew, gained momentum and its members started to get sloppy, cocky or aimed to outdo each other. \"I was probably the one who lost control.\"\\n* \"This megalomaniac church cult took everything from me. It left me with a self-esteem that was completely broken and hacking was a way to rebuild myself. But in so doing, I became this narcissist, this ego-driven maniac. I just became this pathological hacker. \\\\[...\\\\] I didn‚Äôt know how to stop. By 2009, I really realized I had a problem.\"\\n\\n**An interesting story. I recommend it.** And I invite you to take everything with a grain of salt. Like every trauma survivor, he explains his story to himself with the words he choses. I\\'m not saying that he lies. I am saying: many former members of cults are lost and can end up just spiraling into the first liberating thing that comes their way. And for him, maybe, it was hacking. He managed to escape this spiral very late. Or maybe: he was forced out of it. And now all he can do is look back and search for a way to explain what happened.\\n\\nCross-post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/darknetdiaries/comments/hv2p81/ep\\\\_70\\\\_ghost\\\\_exodus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/darknetdiaries/comments/hv2p81/ep_70_ghost_exodus/)\\n\\n**Actual link:** [**https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/70/**](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/70/)', 'author': None, 'reply_to': None, 'conversation_id': 'xysvxh', 'politness_score': 0.38095238095238093, 'readability_score': 0, 'has_reasoning': True, 'site_ref_count': '2'}\n",

You don‚Äôt have to do anything extra during your routine.\\n\\n2. Use saline solution 2x a day. The bleeding is normal since the piercing is new. As long as it isn‚Äôt a huge amount of blood it‚Äôs fine. Just let it dry out and you can clean it gently next time you clean the piercing. Do not try to forcefully remove it though as you can cause it to bleed or make it irritated  (even if you don‚Äôt manage to remove it all, it should fall off during normal cleaning after a few days).\\n\\n3. Don‚Äôt use bepanthen. Although this ointment has wound healing and disinfecting properties, it can cause the piercing hole to clog up and prevent oxygen from entering the wound.

Han had little to nothing to do in the film. \\n\\nHe signed on for all 3 of the sequel trilogy films, the entire trilogy. Don‚Äôt take my word for it though, JJ Abrams talks in depth about it in the behind the scenes documentary for The Force Awakens. Han was never going to die in the script Ford signed on for - Poe was. Later, during a re-write Abrams realized Han‚Äôs death would have more of an emotional impact for the audience and that Poe would live instead. He even talks about his nervousness to break the news to Ford (which eventually freed up his schedule to do Blade Runner 2049). \\n\\nNeed more proof Ford would return? He returned for The Rise of Skywalker to play Han AGAIN after already being killed off. He went to Star Wars Celebration in 2017 for The Last Jedi - a film he wasn‚Äôt even in. He went to the grand opening of Galaxy‚Äôs Edge, he met with Aldin before and after Aldin filmed the Solo film to give advice and encouragement and he went to the red carpet premiere of The Rise of Skywalker as well.\\n\\nHe does not dislike Star Wars, he just prefers Indy.

Being a partner and barista for over 10 years myself I couldn‚Äôt agree more that tenure partners should be getting paid much better then a new barista based off knowledge and skills of the job. This got us talking how would a seniority based union at our store change request off and scheduling preferences. Seeing how the pandemic massively changed the labor force perspective on work/life balance and the need to enjoy and secure your time away from work this seems relevant now more then ever. Being with the store as long as I have I always plan my life out in advance and have request offs in the book well in advance and I‚Äôve heard more then I can even remember at this point of new baristas complaining they couldn‚Äôt get time off because the manager told them that they were too many request already approved in the books long before they even started.

            "{'id': 'ircro81', 'body': 'Hey man. First of all, good on you for trying to make a healthy change! That‚Äôs a big first step - admitting to yourself it‚Äôs time. \\n\\nOne thing I want to address up front is your comment about having NAFLD because you don‚Äôt move. I‚Äôm not a doctor, but this doesn‚Äôt sound right to me. Not exercising doesn‚Äôt cause your liver to store fat. Exercise burns calories, which can help, but the fat comes from eating the wrong foods or too much food. You mentioned eating healthy 6/7 days a week. I question that. Can you give a little more info about what you consider to be ‚Äúhealthy?‚Äù You may be surprised to find out that you‚Äôre unintentionally overeating.\\n\\nYour nightly snack change sounds awesome! I love oatmeal with nuts and fruit! One thing to consider - don‚Äôt stress over eating steel cut oats vs old fashioned rolled oats. Get the rolled oats. They‚Äôre easier to make which may help you stay consistent while you transition. If you really just want to do steel cut, yes Bobs red mill oats are great! They just take longer to cook. Right now I recommend focusing on making your transition easy and sustainable.\\n\\nLastly, DON‚ÄôT PANIC! I know how overwhelming it is, having just changed a few weeks ago. Find some ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù meals that you‚Äôre comfortable eating multiple times a week. Start there and then start modifying them or adding in new dishes when you feel inspired. It‚Äôs a marathon, not a sprint. Don‚Äôt worry about going too fast and too hard and burning yourself out. Try your best and you‚Äôll get where you want as long as the desire is truly in your heart. Best of luck, my man.\\n\\nEdit: also, to help track your ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù days I recommend a calorie counting app. Someone else recommended Chronometer. I‚Äôve also used My Fitness Pal.

Well the real reason and this is not easy to say but I feel for the integrity of the case, the truth should be known. As I stated earlier, we became very close while investigating DP. Well, we fell in love. It was confusing, exciting and intense. However, I was unfaithful and I regret every second of it. This sent Snay over the edge and this is why he went off the rails.
