Just the raw skill and coordination of teaching your oline to pass set, how to move  and use both their hands and feet, and be knee benders NOT hip benders not to mention pass pro strategies and schemes. Plus, teaching WRs how to release, how to beat press coverage and to create separation at the top of their routes along with proper catch mechanics are just some of the factors to go into why a team is successful in the dropback passing game and the differences you see in the pro game and CF and even HS. \n",

If you're a progression based passing game(,which most passing Offenses are because it's easier for the qb than reading coverage) then hardest thing to do is to get your QB to get beyond the first or 2nd read in the progression and the reason for that is because they are usually being  besieged  by the pass rush before they can get pass their first read and you really have to work hard to coach potential bad habits they can develop.  Most passing Offenses understand the point your trying make in regards to the QBs footwork/drops being tied to the routes of the receiver. Certain routes break open or are timed up with the QBs 1st, 2nd, or even 3rd hitch step in his drop and that's regardless of running a pro-style offense, Air Raid, Run-n-shoot, etc. Offense.\n",

            "There's much more to the passing game than what you describe. A solid passing game involves good horizontal and vertical stretches to attack zone along with routes in those stretches that attack man coverage. Along with good progressions that both have good timing (prefeably the 1st route in the progression opens at 1.8 secs or Qbs 5th step from UC- 3 from the Gun, 2nd read opens at 2.2-2.6 secs or 5 with a hitch from UC - 3 with a hitch from the gun,  and the checkdown/outlet throw on the 3rd hitch)  and progressions that bring routes back into the Qbs line of sight. Homer Smith speaks about this  at great length in his Manuals, and Dan Gonzalez is one of the few who still beats this drum. Along with changing the launch point of your QB do not allow defenses to Tee off on your Qb, change the launch point. Incorporate nakeds, boots, rollout, sprints,dash passes, and half-rolls into pass game. Move the pocket. It will also help your offensive line. Lastly, have a plan for the blitz. Are you a protection first type passing game?  Are you willing to Max protect and take a shot or are an 5 man out at all times offense?  Then you better make sure you have answers for pressure whether its blitzes or FZ where they're overloading a side of your protection you better make sure you have a solid plan for that.\n",

            "Context for the specific parts of the video:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. In June 1914, an ethnic Pole assassinates Sergey Sazonov, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, while he's on vacation in Warsaw. In response, Russia demands that Galicia-Lodomeria absorb itself into Congress Poland within a month. Germany, Hungary, and France promise to defending Galician sovereignty and Britain and Austria, to back up Russia. When the deadline arrives, Russia declares war on Galicia-Lodomeria, causing a chain of declarations of war resulting in the First Great War.\n",
            "2. In September 1914, German and Galician forces not only prevent the Russians from taking the Galician capital of Krakow, but also begin a counter-offensive during the First Battle of the Vistula. The next month, not only does Warsaw fall in the Second Battle of the Vistula, Ottoman ships besiege Russian ports in the Black Sea, bringing them into the war on the side of the Entente.\n",
            "3. Ever since the Revolutions of 1848, Italy had been split into two nations: South Italy, also known as the Kingdom of Italy, consisting of the states which supported Sardinia-Piedmont's claim as the rightful ruler of the Italian Peninsula, and North Italy, also known as the Italian Republic, consisting of the states which supported the Roman Republic's claim. Over the years, however, South Italy had garnered the support of Britain and Russia and North Italy, that of France and Germany. As such, in April 1915, South Italy, wanting to finally complete the unification of Italy, signed the Treaty of London, and in May, they declared war on North Italy and France. In September 1918, Italy would, indeed, be reunified-under the Italian Republic.\n",
            "4. Having to defend Galicia-Lodomeria against the Russians, south Germany against the Austrians, and France against the British, the First Great War stretched the German Army thin, and in the early stages of the war, they had trouble coping. However, the Eastern and Western Fronts were deemed top priorities, often leaving the Southern Front under-defended. Ultimately, this resulted in the Battle of Frankfurt in December 1914, one of the first examples of modern urban warfare. With Frankfurt being the capital, the German government was forced to flee to Berlin and the battle served as a wake-up call.\n",
            "5. Over the course of the next 10 months, the German Army swelled from the initial 2 million men mobilized to almost 4 million, and in October 1915, around 1.4 million of them were involved in the Frankfurt-Munich Offensive, to date one of the largest forces ever assembled for a single offensive. The offensive pushed Austrian forces, who were now on the right bank of the Rhine, back to Frankfurt within a month, and by the end of the offensive in June 1916, the frontline will move to about 10 kilometers south of Munich.\n",
            "6. In this timeline, the Russian Revolution more or less goes the same as it does in this timeline-the February Revolution results in the formation of the Provisional Government and later is followed by the October Revolution, causing the Russian Civil War and the end of the war for Russia. However, as Germany is part of the Entente and Russia is part of the Triple Alliance, this kinda makes the Bolsheviks the good guys in the First Great War. However, in the Second Great War, they would revert to being the bad guys, albeit they would win that war, but that's a story for another day.\n",
            "7. Like in our timeline, in July 1917, Alexander Kerensky attempts to secure the position of the Provisional Government via a last ditch offensive, with the ambitious goal of returning the borders to where they were in 1914 and finally defeating Galicia-Lodomeria, appointing Alexei Brusilov to command it, primarily due to his popularity following the success of the Brusilov Offensive. However, the offensive is a catastrophe, ending in 18 days and resulting in no ground being gained and another 60,000 Russian casualties.\n",
            "8. By October 1918, ultimately one month before the end of the war, Britain's position was precarious to say the least. For starters, it no longer had any allies-the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk meant that Russia was out for the count since March 1918, and the Russian Civil War meant it wasn't coming back any time soon, and with the Treaties of Vienna and Villa Giusti, both signed in September 1918 by Austria and South Italy respectively, its other allies had been annexed by Germany and North Italy respectively. Technically, Romania was also there, but number one, it had been under Hungarian occupation since January 1917, and number two, it's Romania, they can't really do much. Secondly, the Royal Navy had been severely weakened and was fighting both the US Navy in the Atlantic and the Reichsflotte and French Navy in the English Channel and North Sea. Thirdly, the British were being pushed back on all fronts. American forces had opened a new front via the invasion of Scotland in April 1918, with Edinburgh falling in June, and Franco-German forces had been on a massive offensive since August 1918, ultimately resulting in British forces being driven out of France completely. This would all result in massive riots by British Republicans across England and Wales, as well as separatists across the Empire. The straw that broke the camel's back, however, came in November 1918, when Germany took advantage of the Royal Navy being distracted and landed in southern England. This ultimately resulted in the abdication of King George V, the formation of the British Republic, and the signing of the Armistice of Birmingham, ending fighting in the war.\n",

Scrub the pieces, rust comes off, leaves the metal very shiny. BUT... little bits of steel wool come off and you'll need to do some clean up afterwards. And use gloves, because when that steel gets in your skin it is going to sting for some time. I just put on two sets of latex gloves. If the outer gets breached, stop, and put on a new one.

            "\n",
            "CAN'T TURN BACK NOW (idkmanokay) - this is a crime Au. Anthony heads the bridgerton crime family. Kate is a lawyer and handles edwina's modelling career. Anthony hires kate as his company's consultant. This retells S2 book story as a modern day. Anthony is in his usual obsessed with kate mode and kate has a dark secret. This fic is sexy and a WIP.\n",
            "\n",
            "A DEVIL'S LOVE (FormerlyIR (Irony_Rocks)) - this is a favourite and it is complete now. Again it's a crime AU but is an AU of both bridgerton and a subplot of The Batman movie. So Anthony is the head of the bridgerton crime family. He operates a club. Kate is looking for a missing edwina. She get's a job at the club. Kate is basically Selina kyle's character from The Batman with a cat and mouse game going on between her and anthony. Anthony is seriously sexy as hell in this fic and pretty dark too. The fic itself is morally grey. But the smut in this is insane. I think this is one of the hottest kate/anthony fics i've ever read. The narrative of the story is amazing too but it definitely facilitates the smut. 🥵🔥\n",
            "\n",
            "WALLS CRUMBLING DOWN (kiaBG) - i really like this one. It follows kate and anthony's marriage. It is a really long fic with lots of heart to hearts with kate and anthony. It's also sweet and sexy too.\n",
            "\n",
            "LETTER'S TO MY BELOVED -  (LoveRemains) this is a sexting fic regency style. Anthony is away on business for the first time. He and kate communicate their horniness through letters. Anthony returns home. I gotta say the smut in the end of this is 🥵. The author wrote one amazing and long sex scene. But i loved this because anthony and kate are so in love and suffer separation anxiety being away from each other. But i'll recommend the author's stories. She captures the heat and sweet perfectly.\n",
            "\n",
            "WHERE WOMEN GLOW AND MEN PLUNDER (iwishyouwouldstop) - this is a modern AU. Honestly what got me into this was that it's set in Australia. It's S2 in Aussie. I'm still reading this but i find it really fun. I love the family dynamics and anthony and kate are true enemies to lovers with no S2 dilution tropes (love at first sight, forbidden love). It's straight hate from kate with hate/lust from anthony.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "PRETTY WOMAN REDUX (LovelyJuice) -  ok this is 😍 and it actually made me go rewatch pretty woman too. I love that anthony is edward and kate vivian. But kate isn't a straight forward hooker in this. You'll know what i mean when you read it. But this is great and a WIP. It's full of love and sexiness with all your favourite pretty woman scenes adapted for kate and anthony. That piano scene is 🔥\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "SAVE THE LAST DANCE FOR ME (collectionoftulips) - ok what i love about this is that at one point the bridgerton's and sharma's are weaved into each other's lives. And then suddenly it all stops. So basically papa bridgerton and papa sharma meet and become friends. Papa sharma brings child kate home to the bridgerton's and she meets child benedict. They become firm friends and constantly spend time together. The sharma's start spending holidays with the bridgerton's at Aubrey Hall. Anthony is on the verge of adulthood and is looking towards learning the viscountancy, so in the narrative is doing away with such childish things. \n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "To begin with he questions kate's wild spirit but then becomes fascinated with her. They start spending time together and become close. The parents are overheard planning kate and benedict to grow up and marry as a match. Anthony doesn't like this but doesn't understand why he feels this way. Basically there is feelings/attraction but kate/anthony are too young/oblivious to understand what's going on. Anthony starts to pull away trying to be the future viscount and this hurts kate. Then kate debuts and anthony dances with her in public. What happens on the dancefloor alarms and scares the parents. They separate kate and anthony who are clueless. And the families distance themselves as a result. The sharma's return to india for years. Then they return. Kate and anthony meet after years apart, as adults now. S2 takes place and Anthony is obsessed. This is a WIP but a unique look at kate/anthony if that desire/love they felt in S2 started to take place throughout childhood over years. I'm looking forward to continuing this.\n",
            "\n",
            "EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE SERIES (55anon (Anon) ) - ok this is really controversial and we're talking 'dead dove do not eat' themed. I think i was compelled to read it because it was fringe and controversial. A fresh and disturbing look with the obsession involved in love. But \"it's not for everyone\" is an understatement. So basically the author gives us an anthony that's feral and obsessive quirks with kate we swoon over in the show. well what if they were more psychologically disturbing and this obsession led him into changing into a dark and violent person? Basically you have regency era serial killer anthony who is consumed with kate. \n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "But it doesn't stop there. What if this kate is into it, sees it as the ultimate devotion and enables the fck out of it? Well you have S2 kate/anthony with sex and violence. The fic is both dominant and submissive, and kate and anthony are true equals but fcked up. But strangely even though there's rough sex and messed up acts. The author captures how much they love each other, and that anthony needs kate to be sane. The fic hinges on the fact that young anthony was in love with and engaged to young kate. Violet makes him give her up. He does and something breaks in him. His family witness it all, make excuses for his behaviour but know he's dangerous. We get internal thoughts from various characters worried about what anthony has become.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Kate leaves but returns years later. Anthony's obsession truly begins. Kate ignores and shuns him which just makes him crazier and more unhinged. Then the games start. And Kate starts them. Yeah, i kinda loved it as i was reading with my mouth open. 😄 but each fic is a one shot but part of a series. But the author is not afraid to go there.\n",

            "\n",
            "INDECENT PROPOSAL (coveredinbees (Fitzchivalry1122) ) -  i'm loving this one too. Another WIP. Anthony get's injured in a botched duel and it effects his physical libido. Until he meets kate that it. 😋 but he employs her as a nurse that makes potions and ointments after he mistakes her for a prostitute in a brothel he wants to spend the night with. But anthony is not just employing her as a nurse. Anthony is drawn to her and becoming obsessed. This is slow burn but well worth the read.\n",
